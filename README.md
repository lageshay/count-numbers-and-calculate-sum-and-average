# count-numbers-and-calculate-sum-and-average
Assignment: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total (sum), counts, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a number, detect their mistake using ‘try’ and ‘except’, print an error message, and skip to the next number.
